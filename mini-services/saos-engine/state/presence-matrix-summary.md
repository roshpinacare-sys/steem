## honest limits
- read-only probe: zero keys, zero broadcasts, zero writes outside the state dir
- page sizes are response byte counts, capped at 200KB per page (truncated flags where hit)
- SPA surfaces (wallet/steemworld/steemscan) render client-side from public APIs — SPA-PARITY means no server-side differential is measurable, not an endorsement of displayed content
- steemit.com differential is server-side at their origin (measured with cache-buster MISS on both fleet and controls, same IP/UA) — git cannot lift it; chain truth is the ledger
- instrument note: primary client is node fetch (undici); some edges TLS-fingerprint-block it (measured: uniform HTTP403 from sandbox). When a WHOLE surface comes back non-200 for fleet AND controls alike, the sweep is re-measured once via the system curl binary (still zero-dep, read-only, same UA/cache-buster) — the client per record is labeled. A uniform block is an instrument failure, not a differential; a fallback that still fails is reported as-is.
- steemdb.io is measured as served; when it is DOWN for fleet AND controls alike it is excluded from the alternates-parity boolean (parity on a dead surface would be a false claim)
